        <h2> Description </h2>

            <p>
                Coming from an Italian background, I always ate homemade lasagna growing up. 
                It was a staple food in our household that always resulted in second servings and stuffed stomachs. 
                This italian classic is another rendition from my grand-mother's cookbook.

                <li> Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor. </li>
                <li> Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste. </li>
                <li> Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce. </li>
                <li> Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper. </li> 
                <li> Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles. </li>
                <li> Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent. </li>
                <li> Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it. </li>
